        <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>
            Man is a social being. He lives in society. As a gregarious and social being he lives and interacts with so
            many people all through his life. In our interactions with people we make many friends. We enjoy the company
            of our friends; in fact that is why they are our friends. We influence our friends, and likewise our friends
            influence us. Friendships therefore have a great bearing on our life. That is why we must be choosy when we
            make friends, because we want long lasting true friends whom we may trust and who, in turn, can trust us.
            Friendship calls for loyalty. If you cannot be loyal to your friends, you will lose them. In a real
            friendship that has matured over time, there are not even any expectations between two friends. You love
            your friend whatever may happen, and you love not for any reason or to get anything in return from your
            friend. And this is the sentiment shared by your friend too. Such a friendship is a real friendship and it
            gives true joy and contentment. Even troubles and miseries that life may bring seem insignificant when you
            have such a friendship to bank on.</p>
