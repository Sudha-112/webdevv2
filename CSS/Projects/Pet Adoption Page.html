        <h3>Meet Tatum</h3>
        <p>Meet Tatum! Little Tatum Tot is the full package. He’s a talkative and opinionated cat who loves to engage with humans. He’s absolutely gorgeous! He’s a strong young male cat who enjoys being active and exploring.

            Tatum is incredibly loving and a total companion cat. He is a lap cat, a shoulder cat, and a cuddler, and you can even dress him up in outfits for the holidays! He’ll follow you around the house and then sit next to you on the couch.
            
            He loves feather toys, scratchers, and laser points. He says he prefers to have his own space to do his activities without other pets bugging him all the time. He might be an introvert..
            
            Tater is FIV positive, which means he is immunocompromised and should have a healthy diet and safe indoor life.
            
            If you’ve made it this far, then you can tell that there’s something special about Tatum. There is! This kitty is ready to thrive and make someone very, very happy. He will make a great friend and active companion. He’s totally a cool dude!

    <h3>Meet Spot</h3>
    <p>Meet Spot! Spot is a 3-year-old, 45 lb mixed breed dog that is fully vetted, house-trained, crate-trained and is still working on his leash-walking skills. Spot loves all dogs, does well with cats, and is good with children, although supervision is advised when Spot is around small children as he could accidentally knock them down. Put in your application to adopt Spot today!”
        
        Many would argue that healthy and friendly is what most families want in a pet. But what in this bio would make me want Spot instead of another dog? What makes Spot special? What might make a family say, “Spot is the dog for us!” and drop everything to immediately submit an application for adoption?
        
       He is a charming and a well mannered dog.He most certainly will claim a spot on the sofa and may take your spot in the bed, but the warm snuggles are a perfect trade-off. Spot loves to run and will help you find that sweet spot on your daily jog.Adopt Spot for a spot-on perfect pet!”</p>
